Cirrus Design uses state-of-the-art GPR technology for identifying whatever is needed beneath the surface. The type of GPR that we use is for identifying objects in concrete, such as: rebar, pipe, conduit, voids, power cables, as well as identifying slab thickness. Once your scan is complete, we can have a report ready!

Our team is ready to help our clients develop cost-effective solutions to complex problems.

We encourage you to reach out to our team about any GPR services.
