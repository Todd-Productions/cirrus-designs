Our 3D scanning technology offers a powerful and effective means to gather current conditions, which includes machine locations, piping, equipment and existing building structure. In our experience, we’ve found that older plants are often lacking accurate prints or drawings.

The Cirrus Design 3D scanning of industrial plants allows our customers to accurately map and document existing conditions and plan future projects – and avoid the need to recapture the same documentation with each project.

A detailed three-dimensional digital twin of a hydro or industrial plant, accurate to within 1/8th of an inch, can be created safely, quickly and efficiently, without outages or disruption to the operation of the facility.
