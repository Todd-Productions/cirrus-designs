Three-dimensional scanning technology has revolutionized the real estate industry, providing truly immersive 3D walkthroughs and virtual tours. Today’s high-tech 3D scanners are capable of producing digital scans of essentially any building, from residential homes and condominiums to warehouses and commercial buildings – plus everything in between.

Real estate sellers can provide in-depth digital imagery to prospective clients, and buyers can use those scans to digitally view properties that they have yet to set foot inside. Cirrus Design has the knowledge and tools to create complete, 3-dimensional interactive walkthroughs of floor plans. We also provide aerial drone footage, dollhouse views that show an entire home opened up and viewed from above, plus beautiful 4K photography and videos.
