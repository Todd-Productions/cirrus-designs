Cirrus Design can help your company reverse engineer a product, converting a point cloud into a 3D model.

Our 3D technology and capabilities have helped our clients reverse engineer machinery wear items and parts with complex geometry, such as turbines, bearings and scroll cases. Cirrus Design’s three-dimensional scanning services saves you  time and budget by alleviating the need to physically visit a plant or facility to capture basic information, imagery or specific dimensions. All of that data becomes accessible from the 3D Point Cloud that we provide, giving a high-resolution and distortion-free visualization of the structure that’s accessible from the comfort of your office.
