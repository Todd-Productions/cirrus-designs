3D Scanning is the process for digitally capturing the precise shape, size and texture of real-world objects or physical environments. For example, when you need to digitize assets for enhanced engineering and design workflows or achieve a digital twin of your facility for compliance and safety, 3D Scanning will precisely create what is known as a point cloud, or a set of data points, by measuring many points on the external surface of an existing object. This process is also known as reality capture.


Cirrus Design leverages multiple products and technologies, including scanners from industry leaders like Matterport and Faro. We can take precise measurements from the field that can be viewed from the comfort of your office. We use AutoCAD, Autodesk Recap, Inventor and Solidworks, and our accurate scanned measurements can be turned into detailed shop drawings.
