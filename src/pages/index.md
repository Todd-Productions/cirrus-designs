  description: "Cirrus Design provides professional services in the 3D scanning and modeling industries and offers a wide array of design services. Our experienced team uses the most up-to-date technologies available to offer our clients the highest quality service at competitive rates.


Our combination of experience and technical know-how means that we’re uniquely equipped to specialize in 3D scanning and modeling of hydroelectric power plants. Generating accurate 3D maps of hydro plants presents a unique challenge. In some cases, these facilities and their buildings are more than 100 years old and existing documentation is often incorrect or lacking entirely.


Cirrus Design's team will record every dimension of a hydro plant – to exacting measurements within 1/8th of an inch –  and generate a truly accurate representation of what exists at the plant. We help ensure compliance and safety standards for a wide range of industries,  such as construction, agriculture, energy and more.


In addition to our work in three-dimensional scanning and modeling technologies, Cirrus Designs focuses on Industrial engineering, real estate, reverse engineering, conceptual design. We also offer our clients mechanical and electrical controls design services.
